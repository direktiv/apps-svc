  A usql wrapper workflow for database operations so calling workflows don't need to construct their own connection strings.
  Ensure that the database secrets have been configured.
  Note that dbaddr should include a database name. For example: 192.168.1.1/apps
functions:
- id: usql
  image: localhost:5000/usql
  type: knative-workflow
states:
- id: sql
  type: action 
  action:
    function: usql 
    secrets:
    - dbuser
    - dbpass
    - dbaddr
    input:
      connection: 'jq(("pg://" + (.secrets.dbuser | @uri) + ":" + (.secrets.dbpass | @uri) + "@" + .secrets.dbaddr))'
      queries: 'jq([{query: .queries[], args: .args}])'
